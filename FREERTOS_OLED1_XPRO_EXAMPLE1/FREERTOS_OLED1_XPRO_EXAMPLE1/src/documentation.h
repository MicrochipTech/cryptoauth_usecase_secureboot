 * \mainpage FreeRTOS demo using OLED1 Xplained Pro

 *
 *
 * \section appdoc_intro Introduction
 *
 * This application demonstrates basic use of the
 * <a href="http://www.freertos.org">FreeRTOS</a> real-time operating system
 * on SAM D devices. More specifically, it demonstrates use of tasks, queues
 * and mutexes (semaphores).
 *
 * The application is designed to run on a SAM D Xplained Pro board with a
 * OLED1 Xplained Pro wing board connected to EXT port.
 *
 * After start-up, the application will display a pseudo-random graph that is
 * continuously updated on the OLED, along with a menu bar at the bottom. The
 * menu bar shows the selection of screens that the user has. By pressing the
 * corresponding buttons on the OLED1 Xplained Pro wing board, the user can
 * select between:
 * - "Graph": pseudo-random graph.
 * - "Term.": text received from terminal, i.e., the EDBG Virtual COM Port.
 * - "About": short description of the application and use of terminal-screen.
 *
 * Further, the LEDs on the OLED1 Xplained Pro wing board are lit up for the
 * duration of the various tasks' loops, simply to give a visual representation
 * of the task switching:
 * - LED1: update of graph and handling of incoming terminal characters.
 * - LED2: printing terminal and about text.
 * - LED3: checking user selection, handling display buffer and menu drawing.
 *
 * Note that several LEDs can be lit up at one time if one task is waiting for
 * another task to release a resource. In this application, the resources would
 * be the mutexes for the display and terminal text buffer.
 *
 * To write text to the terminal window, one must connect to the EDBG Virtual
 * COM Port with a terminal emulator at a baud rate of 9.6 kbaud. The demo will
 * echo back the received characters.
